Instead of navigating through many websites, they may explore and find the right course for their children in one app. This improvement would save them time and energy while also enhancing their quality of life in a foreign nation.

                This project followed the Experience-driven design and CUE model.
              </p>
              <p class="section-description">
                Experience-Driven Design is about understanding the experiences needed by users that will be built into a solution. According to Hassenzahl, experience-driven design starts by studying and setting as a priority the needs of the user. Once there is an understanding of these needs, experiences will be established to solve these needs and implement them in the solution.
              </p>
              <p class="section-description">
                As for the CUE model, the user experience may be characterized in this framework as a set of different components interacting in a certain way. Instrumental quality perceptions, non-instrumental quality perceptions, and emotional user reactions are the three major elements of user experience, as shown in Figure 1. These three components determine the outcomes of the user experience. Acceptance of the system and usage behavior are examples of consequences.
              </p>
              <p class="section-description">
                All three elements of the user experience work together to define the user's overall impression of the system and, as a result, affect future choices and actions.

                  Gathering all information into a single space would allow parents more possibilities for the exploration of options. With more options, there will be an increase in discovery. When the child and their parents look through all of the programs provided, these experiences may be produced. The app could potentially allow parents to select their favorite classes into a list. Then show the detailed information of classes to the kids so they can select their favorite option.

In general, the efficiency goal is shown through the helpfulness, ease of use, and learnability of the system.

              <p class="section-description">
                The <strong>meCUE questionnaire</strong> and <strong>interviews</strong> were utilized as evaluation methods. The meCUE questionnaire is a questionnaire made for standardized measurement of UX which was developed based on Thüring and Mahlke's Component Model of User Experience(2007). The meCUE questionnaire provides for the evaluation of major components of User Experience in a modular format. The questionnaire consists of 34 items and is divided into four modules, each of which has been independently verified and relates to the perception of various product qualities.

              <h4 class="result-heading">From meCUE questionnaire</h4>
              <p class="section-description">
                Overall, the results are quite encouraging; the calculated mean values for instrumental qualities are pretty high; the value for usefulness is 5.93, and the value for usability is 6.13. Because we primarily concentrated on pragmatic features when creating the prototype, the value for non-instrumental qualities is lower, as predicted. If the project is developed more in the future, these elements can be enhanced. When it comes to the emotion module, it's clear that it's more on the positive side. The outcome of the consequences module is also not poor, with a value of 3.73 for intention to use and 4.87 for product loyalty. The overall evaluation score is 4.4, which is relatively high compared to the highest score of 5. By this result, we may state that our efficiency goal has been met.

                This is my first time using Experience-driven design and CUE model, to be honest I am quite satisfied with the outcomes. Using these two methods helped me to look into things from a different angle. Instead of designing for a certain problem, we are designing for a certain experience. This project has also helped me to know how to understand users with empathy and how to think in their shoes.
